- Create 2 terminals, one to run your server side js and the other to run your client side js
  - node index.js (to run server)
  - node public/script.js (to run fetch calls)
- Paste in your own base URL, when the **server crashes** don't forget to make it **public** when you restart it!
- Uncomment the route handlers, debug, uncomment the fetch calls, debug. **TEST AS YOU GO**


- Refer to **Unit 5: Lesson 12 - Fetch Review** for reference!
- You will have an **exit ticket** at the end of the period, testing your ability to write a route handler and test it with a fetch request!
